	  My name is Chase Vander Dussen, I am 18 years old and going to be 19 in November. This is my first home page that I made on my own. I go to New Vista School, and I'm going to be graduating next year. I've been going to this school for six years now and I can't wait to graduate. I currently take a coding class and I really enjoy it so far.
	  
	  </p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends, playing videogames, and occasionally drawing art. I also like playing laser tag with my friends and my dad.<p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the first browser and server software in late 1990.</p>
	  <p>The first description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.</p>
